## Installation

Atom/Pulsar provides a built-in way to download and install packages, but for local development, you'll want to do it this way.

1. Clone this repo.
2. Open your terminal, navigate into the repo directory, then run `apm link` or `ppm link`.
3. Back in Atom, you should now see groq-suggestions installed in `Settings -> Packages -> groq-suggestions`.
4. Provide your Api key in the settings.
5. use `ctrl` + `shift` + `p` and select the desired `Groq Suggestions` command
